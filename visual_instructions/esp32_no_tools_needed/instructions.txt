These instructions assume that you don't have any tools. If you have a soldering iron and wire cutters and better tape and/or heat shrink, you should clearly use them, but if you can do that, you don't really need these instructions...

1) This is what you need to assemble the full kit:
* ESP32 module with antenna
* Tape roll and/or double sided tape
* USB solar panel
* Battery holder
* 1.2V batteries (the bigger the better) OR, any 3.6 or 3.7 volt battery (li-ion, lipo, etc.)

2) First thing first: check that the esp32 module is in good shape.

3) Connect the antenna - you'll have to carefully push down the coaxial connector.

4) Strip the wires for the battery case. You can use the tape roll if you have nothing better. 1.5cm or half an inch is sufficient.

5) This should be your end result.

6) Do the same with the wires that came with the esp32 module.

7) This should be your end result.

8) You have to connect these red to red and black to black.

9) Twist the wires together, bending them backwards afterward.

10) Using the tape, cover one wire (Doing black here). Make sure you cover it fully. 

11) Using the tape, cover the other. Make sure you cover it fully. Leave some tape hanging.

12) Use the tape you left hanging earlier to wrap around your connection. It doesn't look pretty, but it will hold for a long time.

13) Now you can put the batteries in. Mind your polarity! Put the little connector in its socket on the bottom of the esp32 module.

14) Connect the USB solar panel to the USB connector on the esp32. You're done!

15) If you have a different battery, same principle up until step 13 -- be sure to connect red to red and black to black.

16) If you have a USB powerbank, connect it between the ESP32 and the solar panel.
