CellSol: Long Range Solar Powered Communications Network

## Firmware

There are two firmwares for CellSol pylons: the ESP32 firmware and the Arduino Nano firmware. The former is for the ESP32 WiFi Pylon, and the latter for the Arduino Repeater Pylon.

These can be found under ESP32/esp32_wifi_bt and nano/nano_one_serial_port respectively. We will also publish binaries on the website for major releases.

See the [CellSol website](https://www.f3.to/cellsol) for more information.
