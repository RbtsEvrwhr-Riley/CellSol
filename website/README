This is a website built using Hugo (https://www.gohugo.io) and the Geekdocs theme (https://geekdocs.de/)

If you wish to preview the site locally, install Hugo on your environment, then simply run "hugo server" in this directory.

The "config.toml" file does the magic.

Refer to the Hugo documentation for everything else. Content is all markdown files in the "content" directory.
