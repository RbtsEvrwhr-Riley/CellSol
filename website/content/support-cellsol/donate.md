In the near future, we will begin accepting donations to fund further development and expansion of the CellSol project.

Funds will be first allocated towards purchasing hardware and equipment for the expansion of the project, then paying for development effort where possible. While we
expect most development effort to come from our volunteers, large hardware and architecture developments will ideally be funded via donations.

CellSol is an open-source project owned by Robots Everywhere, LLC. While it may become its own nonprofit charity organization in the future, the overhead for doing so is 
outside the current scope of both the project and its finances.

If you're interested in supporting the project in the meantime, [contact the project admins](mailto:cellsol@robots-everywhere.com) by email.
