Case designs for the Arduino Repeater Pylon are a work in progress.

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4660194 - This is our current case design. It has room for a small battery, and exposes the USB port.

These are not very weather resistant; we recommend using them for pocket pylons, or for indoor use, and applying a gasket and transparent screen protector film on the
exposed ports. Layer sealant, such as silicone paint or epoxy, may also help the weather resistance of this case. We recommend waterproof project boxes for outdoor use.
