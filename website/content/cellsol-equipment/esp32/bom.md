Everything you need for the LoRa32-based WiFi Pylon

* A Heltec Lora32 or Lora32v2 module
* The Arduino software, available [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* A USB cable
* Battery holder (if needed for your battery)
* 1.2V batteries (the bigger the better) OR, any 3.6 or 3.7 volt battery (li-ion, lipo, etc.) See [Powering the Node](power)
* Battery connector for the Lora32 module (should come with the Lora32)
* A solar panel to charge the battery (optional, USB may also be used for charging if the pylon is connected to mains)
* A case for your Lora32, antenna, and battery - see our [case designs](../case-designs)
