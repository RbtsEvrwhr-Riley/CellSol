We currently have two case designs for the ESP32 WiFi Pylon developed.

These are not very weather resistant; we recommend using them for pocket pylons, or for indoor use, and applying a gasket and transparent screen protector film on the
exposed ports. Layer sealant, such as silicone paint or epoxy, may also help the weather resistance of this case. We recommend waterproof project boxes for outdoor use.
