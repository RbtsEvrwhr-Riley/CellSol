Kay is the chief engineer of the CellSol project, having designed all of the system's specifications, hardware, most of the firmware, and is the driving force behind
the project's philosophy of relentless improvement.

Kay has been an inventor for as long as anyone can remember, having worked on network systems for homes, small businesses, and libraries in Italy in the early days of the Internet, as far back as 1990. They
went on to study Electrical and Computer Engineering at St Mary's University, in San Antonio, Texas, and founded [Robots Everywhere](https://www.robots-everywhere.com) along with Riley August. Since then,
they have been designing and implementing solutions in instrumentation, data logging, robotics, light duty manufacturing, and many other areas for both public and private clients. 
The [L-Cheapo Laser Cutter](https://www.robots-everywhere.com/lcheapo) is another of Kay's prominent works.

CellSol is not Kay's first charity project by any means, having worked with the Aaron Swartz Day Hackathon in the past on several projects including the 
[Swartz-Manning VR Destination](https://www.aaronswartzday.org/vr/) and [ASD Solar Survival Project](https://www.aaronswartzday.org/solarsurvival/), though Kay is recorded as Matteo Borri in their media and
communications.

When not trying to change the world through innovative technology, Kay enjoys exploring, both real places and virtual, by swimming, sailing, and cycling. Kay is also a prolific writer of fantasy and science
fiction; some of their work can be found at the [Emlia Foundation Website](https://emlia.org/pmwiki/pub/web/VeryDifferentPlaces.VeryDifferentPlaces.html)
