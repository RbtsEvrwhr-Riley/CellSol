Robots Everywhere was founded by Kay Borri and Riley August as a robotics consultancy in 2008. Since then, they have developed many navigation, instrumentation, robotics, 
and manufacturing solutions for the public and private sectors, as well as the maker community. The company has always believed in doing the best for humanity, and with
the many crises plaguing the year 2020, Robots Everywhere has chosen this time to help develop launch CellSol to allow people to come together in the future.
